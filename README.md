Still need to find 202 more quotes before I have one for each day of the year!

Deployed on Heroku: [http://arcane-inlet-24006.herokuapp.com/](http://arcane-inlet-24006.herokuapp.com/)

You can navigate to the site in a brower you will recieve a json object as response containing quote

If you use jsonp with a callback you will recieve the data wrapped in the callback function
